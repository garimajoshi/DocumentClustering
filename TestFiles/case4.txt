The Civil War was waged because 11 southern states seceded (broke away and started their own government) from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. The secession took place primarily because of a long-standing debate concerning states rights, and more specifically the issue of slavery. As new territories became states, opponents of slavery and advocates of slavery often clashed over whether or not that state should allow slavery. After violence broke out in Kansas over the issue, and after Kansas entered the Union as a free state, southerners began to believe that the new president, Abraham Lincoln would take away their rights to make local decisions and would abolish slavery. Henceforth, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas broke away from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. Richmond, Virginia was made its capital and Jefferson Davis was made president. Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and Missouri were divided on the issue and were declared "border states". On April 14, 1861, Congress declared war on the Confederate States of America for the purposes of preserving the Union.
