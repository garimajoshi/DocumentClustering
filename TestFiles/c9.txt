And that made all the difference.
Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost's poem. Choosing not to listen to my highly
educated dad's advice and attitude about money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that
shaped the rest of my life.
Once I made up my mind whom to listen to, my education about money began. My rich dad taught
me over a period of 30 years, until I was age 39. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully
understood what he had been trying to drum into my often thick skull.
Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and
goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin
building wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most people went to
school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working for money.
Because I was only 9 years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad taught me were simple. And
when it was all said and done, there were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is
about those six lessons, put as simply as possible as my rich dad put forth those lessons to me. The
lessons are not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will assist you and your children
to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.
