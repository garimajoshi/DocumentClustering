Thomas Edison was born February 11, 1847 in Milan, Ohio. He was nicknamed "Al" at an early age. At age 11, Edison moved to Michigan where he spent the remainder of his childhood.

Thomas Edison struggled at school, but learned to love reading and conducting experiments from his mother who taught him at home. At age 15, Edison became a "tramp telegrapher", sending and receiving messages via morse code, an electronically-conveyed alphabet using different clicks for each letter. Eventually, he worked for the Union Army as a telegrapher. Edison often entertained himself by taking things apart to see how they worked. Soon, he decided to become an inventor.

In 1870, Edison moved to New York City and improved the stock ticker. He soon formed his own company that manufactured the new stock tickers. He also began working on the telegraph, and invented a version that could send four messages at once. Meanwhile, Edison married Mary Stillwell, had three children and moved his family to Menlo Park, New Jersey where he started his famous laboratory.
