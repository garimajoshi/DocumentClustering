He became interested in computer programming when he was 13. These were the days of giant mainframe computers. The school had a fund-raiser to purchase a teletype terminal so students could use computer time that was donated by General Electric. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program using BASIC, one of the first computer languages. Later he created a computer version of Risk, a board game he liked in which the goal is world domination. Lakeside is where Bill met Paul Allen who shared his interest in computers. Gates and Allen and two other students hacked into a computer belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to get free computer time. They lost their computer privileges. After a period of probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to fix glitches in CCC's software. At age 17, Gates and Allen were paid $20,000 for a program called Traf-O-Data that was used to count traffic.
