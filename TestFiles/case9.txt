Although the Cowboys made the playoffs five times in the 1980â€™s, they failed to make the Super Bowl. A major turning point for the Cowboys occurred in 1989 when Arkansas businessman Jerry Jones purchased the team. Jones immediately fired coach Tom Landry, who had been the only head coach in Cowboys history to that point. He hired University of Miami Head Coach Jimmy Johnson. They also traded star running back Herschel Walker and drafted UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman with the first pick of the NFL draft. The 1989 season, however, would prove to be one of the worst in Cowboy history. That year they won only one game and lost fifteen. Things would soon get better. In 1990, the Cowboys drafted University of Florida running back Emmitt Smith with their first round pick. With the combination of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and University of Miami wide receiver Michael Irvin, the Cowboys would soon become one of the most exciting teams in the NFL. By 1991, the Cowboys were back in the playoffs, and by 1992, they were back at the Super Bowl, defeating the Buffalo Bills 52-17, in the second most lopsided Super Bowl score in history. Coach Jimmie Johnson became the first coach to win the Super Bowl and an NCAA Championship. The following year, the Cowboys once again dominated their competition and defeated the Buffalo Bills for a second time, 30-13. During the 1992 season, eleven Dallas Cowboys were named to the Pro Bowl, a new NFL record. The Cowboys would also win Super Bowl XXX (30) against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1995, by the score of 27-17
