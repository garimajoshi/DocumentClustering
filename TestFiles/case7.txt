IBM was one of the biggest computer companies at this time. In 1980, they asked Microsoft to write software to run their new personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft kept the licensing rights for the operating system (MS-DOS) so that they earned something for every computer sold first by IBM, and later by all the other companies that made PC computers. Microsoft grew from 25 employees in 1978 to over 90,000 today. Microsoft developed many new technologies. Gates used questionable business practice to get ahead. He has been described as brilliant but childlike, driven, competitive, intense, fun, but lacking in empathy.

Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world. In 2012 the Forbes list of richest people in the world placed him second with $61 billion in assets. Steve Ballmer is #44 with $15.7 billion; and Paul Allen is #48 with $14.2 billion. In 2006, Gates announced that he would cut back his involvement at Microsoft to spend more time on philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports many causes. Some are: helping to eradicate polio; fighting AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; providing vaccinations for children and even reinventing the toilet among many other things.
