The New York Jets were established in 1959. Originally called the Titans of New York, the team was a founding member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. They now play in the American Football Conference (AFC) East Division and share a stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey with the New York Giants.

The original franchise was awarded to Harry Wismer, a sports broadcaster. The Titans struggled financially in its first three years, and by 1962 was nearly bankrupt. In 1963, the Titans were purchased by a group led by business executive Sonny Werblin for one million dollars. Werblin renamed the team the Jets because it played at Shea Stadium and was close to La Guardia Airport. In 1968, Werblin sold the team to petroleum magnate Leon Hess. 

In 1969, the New York Jets won Super Bowl III defeating the NFL’s heavily favored Baltimore Colts, 16-7, in what was one of the last championship games before the leagues merged in 1970. Super Bowl III, however, is most famous for Jets quarterback Joe Namath’s guarantee that the Jets would win (even though he was allegedly drunk when he made the declaration.) Broadway Joe, as he came to be known, was the AFL Rookie-of-the-Year in 1965 and became the first quarterback in professional football history to throw for over 4,000 yards. He would be named Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl III.

In 1970, Joe Namath and the New York Jets played in the first ever Monday Night Football game, losing to the Cleveland Browns in front of a record 85,703 people. After the merger of the NFL and AFL, the Jets suffered through more than a decade of mediocrity before losing in the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins, 14-0 in 1983.
